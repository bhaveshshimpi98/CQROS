"""CQROS reporting dataset repository.

Purpose:
    Provide a path-free facade for persisting and retrieving canonical
    reporting year partitions produced by the CQROS Reporting Engine.

Responsibilities:
    - Resolve storage locations for reporting year partitions via
      ``StorageLayout.reporting_path``
    - Persist, load, check existence, and discover reporting partitions
    - Validate frames against ``REPORTING_SCHEMA`` before save
    - Cast loaded frames to ``REPORTING_SCHEMA`` after read
    - Discover managers, symbols, timeframes, and year partitions under the
      reporting tier
    - Delegate all read and write operations to an injected ``IDataStore``
      (typically ``ParquetStore`` for atomic Parquet writes)
    - Keep filesystem paths out of the public API
    - Remain free of reporting generation and trading logic

Dependencies:
    ``polars``, ``cqros.core``, ``cqros.reporting.exceptions``,
    ``cqros.reporting.schema``, and ``cqros.storage`` layout/interfaces.

Public API:
    ``ReportingPartitionRef``, ``ReportingRepository``

Notes:
    Schema validation and casting keep the on-disk contract aligned with
    ``REPORTING_SCHEMA``. Metadata generation belongs to the engine and
    pipeline. This module must not import reporting engines for execution.
